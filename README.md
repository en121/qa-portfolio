## üìå About Me

I am a career changer aspiring to become a professional QA Engineer, with a strong passion for software quality and continuous learning.

Previously, I worked in the service industry for over 5 years, which trained me to be highly detail-oriented, patient, and focused on delivering excellent customer experiences.  
In the past three months, I have been intensively learning software testing, focusing on both manual and automation testing skills.

During my learning journey, I have mastered Python, Selenium WebDriver, Postman, Git, and basic testing methodologies.  
One of my proudest achievements was successfully automating the login process of a real-world website using Selenium and Python, overcoming challenges such as element identification and script debugging.

I am open to opportunities in both startups and established companies, and I am eager to contribute my dedication, learning spirit, and testing skills to ensure product quality.

This portfolio showcases the hands-on projects I completed during my journey to become a qualified QA Engineer.
